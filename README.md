## About me ðŸ˜Ž

Hello ! I'm TimothÃ©. I love working on new projects, either dev oriented or research oriented.
I am interested by AI and Deep Learning, and in particular I am passionated by Reinforcement Learning. ðŸ¤–

I followed various courses at CentraleSupÃ©lec (Paris) while learning by myself about these domains. I aim to do research on a at least very related field in the future.

## My current projects :question:

I have a lot of interest for Reinforcement Learning and have been developping my personal pytorch framework for Deep RL. I'm creating and teaching courses and practical works in the RL field, intended for students of the University Paris-Saclay's campus.

I'm also very interested in other sub-fields of AI such as game theory, optimization, graph search problems and have been creating my own frameworks for dealing with these topics.
