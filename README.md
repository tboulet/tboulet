# Welcome to my GitHub profile ! ✨

## About me 🙂

I am a french PhD student in AI specialized in LLM for Code Generation. My research is about building Software Engineering Agents (SWE-Agents), i.e. LLM-based systems interacting with a codebase through a terminal interface to solve a long-term coding task, such as solving a GitHub issue, an embodied environment or even lead a research project. I believe this framework can tackle a vast quantity of tasks and is extremely promising for the future of AI.

I have also interest on other AI fields such as Supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning,  Game Theory/Game Playing AI, Operational Research and Search Problems/Decision Making.
