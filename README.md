## About me ðŸ™‚

My name is TimothÃ© Boulet and I am a french Machine Learning Engineer specialized in Deep Learning. In particular, I have a lot of interest for Reinforcement Learning. I also worked on other DL fields such as Supervised Learning, Time Series, NLP, and AI Safety & Alignment, and on other AI fields such as Game Theory/Game Playing AI, Operational Research and Search Problems/Decision Making.

My curriculum (details on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tboulet)):
- Research Intern at [FLOWERS](https://flowers.inria.fr/) (INRIA's Reinforcement Learning team in Bordeaux (France)): Studying the dynamics of Ecosystems of Neural Agents - 6 months

- Maths Vision Apprentissage ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) master at Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure Paris Saclay : one of the most renowned masters in europe for machine learning - 1 year

- R&D intern at [Ubisoft La Forge](https://www.ubisoft.com/fr-fr/studio/laforge) MontrÃ©al: Deep Learning applied to Video Games - 6 months

- Research intern at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/) Paris : Deep RL for optimization in maritime Network Design - 6 months
  
- Student at [CentraleSupÃ©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) : top 3 French Engineer School (Deep Learning lessons and many more) - 3 years

## My current professional project ðŸ¤–

Currently, I'm doing a research internship at FLOWERS on modeling ecosystems of neural agents. The code is publicly available [here](https://github.com/tboulet/EcoJAX).

## Educational Purposes Projects ðŸŽ“

- [Creation and teaching of courses on AI and Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/tboulet/Formation-Reinforcement-Learning).
- Web App : A [playground for Reinforcement Learning](https://share.streamlit.io/tboulet/formation-reinforcement-learning/main/app.py) algorithms. It is a simple app that allows you to play with different environments, algorithms, and hyperparameters.
- A [Gridworld Reinforcement Learning Environment and Framework](https://github.com/tboulet/gridworld_rl).

## Personal Projects ðŸ”¥
