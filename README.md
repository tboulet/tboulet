## About me ðŸ™‚

My name is TimothÃ© Boulet and I am a french Machine Learning Engineer specialized in Deep Learning. In particular, I have a lot of interest for Reinforcement Learning. I also worked on other DL fields such as Supervised Learning, Time Series, NLP, and AI Safety & Alignment, and on other AI fields such as Game Theory/Game Playing AI, Operational Research and Search Problems/Decision Making.

I followed various courses at CentraleSupÃ©lec (Paris) while learning by myself about these domains. I aim to do research on a related field in the future.

My curriculum (details on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tboulet)):
- Student at [CentraleSupÃ©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) : top 3 french Engineer School (Deep Learning lessons and many more) - 3 years

- Maths Vision Apprentissage ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) master at Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure Paris Saclay : one of the most renowned masters in europe for machine learning - 1 year

- Research intern at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/) : Deep RL for optimization in maritime Network Design - 6 months

- R&D intern at [Ubisoft La Forge](https://www.ubisoft.com/fr-fr/studio/laforge): Deep Learning applied to Video Games - 6 months


## Personal Projects ðŸ”¥

- Research project with Google DeepMind : Leagues methods for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning. Repo for a related project (IndependentRL benchmark) [here](https://github.com/tboulet/MARL-Benchmark-with-OpenSpiel).
- [Creation and teaching of courses on AI and Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/tboulet/Formation-Reinforcement-Learning).
- [Deep RL Framework](https://github.com/tboulet/Deep-RL-Framework) : a framework made by myself for Deep Reinforcement Learning. It is based on the OpenAI Gym and pytorch.
- Web App : A [playground for Reinforcement Learning](https://share.streamlit.io/tboulet/formation-reinforcement-learning/main/app.py) algorithms. It is a simple app that allows you to play with different environments, algorithms, and hyperparameters.
- [AI agents for Search Problems](https://github.com/tboulet/AI-Agents-for-Search-Problems) : a python package for Search Problems and Search Algorithms (DFS, A*,...). PyPI package : ``SearchProblemsAI``.
- [AI agents for Games](https://github.com/tboulet/AI-Agents-for-Games) : a python package for Perfect Information Extensive-from Games (Chess, Connect4,...) and some algorithm ((Expecti)MiniMax, MCTS, ...).
- A [Gridworld Reinforcement Learning Environment and Framework](https://github.com/tboulet/gridworld_rl).
- [LocalPerf](https://github.com/tboulet/Local-Python-Performance) : an easy-to-use package for measuring the performance of python in any machine, in terms of CPU, multiprocessing and GPU (pytorch with CUDA), and also verify that the GPU is used. PyPI package : ``localperf``.
- Telegram bot : Sold-out Tickets Detector. Repository [here](https://github.com/tboulet/Sold-out-Tickets-Detector).
- [IntegOR](https://github.com/tboulet/IntegOR) : a python package based on scipy.optimize that aims to traduce an Operation Research problem that can be linearized to a binary integer linear problem, to solve it. PyPI package : ``integor``.
- Stable Baselines 3 Full Pipeline. A repository built on top of SB3 with some additional features. Repository [here](https://github.com/tboulet/StableBaselines3FullPipeline).
- [Backtracking](https://github.com/tboulet/backtracking_algorithm) : A python package for backtracking algorithm, as an interface and a solving function. PyPI package : ``backtracking``.
- Student Project : [Task Scheduling with A* and IDA*](https://github.com/tboulet/task-scheduling).
- Computer Vision Project : [Facial Expression Recognition](https://github.com/tboulet/Face-Expression-Recognition). Information [here](https://www.hubia.org/post/facial-expression-recognition-algorithm).
